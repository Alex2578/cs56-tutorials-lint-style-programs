# Lint4j

TODO: Put a build.xml in this directory along with some Java Source code that compiles and runs, BUT has "problems" in it
that Lint4j can detect.

For example

* if Lint4j can detect unused variables, put in some unused variables.
* if lint4j can detect BLAH BLAH BLAH, put in some BLAH BLAH BLAH...
* Put in as many things as you can find, up to the point where it feels like its no longer useful.

You could have multiple classes with names like UnusedVariable.java

or you could have just one class with a name like Lint4JDemo.java, and have methods such as:

```
  public void unusedVariable(int x) {
    // insert some code here
  }
```

Also, add to this README.md some advice on how, if you already have a Java project in the style of this course (i.e. with a src directory
and packages, and a lib directory with the jar for junit.jar, and a build.xml), how to add Lint4J into
your project's repo.  That probably means:

* download a jar into yoru lib directory
* add some code to the build.xml
