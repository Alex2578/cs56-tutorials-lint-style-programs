==================================

A tutorial about how to use JLint, Lint4j, and similar such utilities.

"Lint-like-utilities" are programs that take in Java Source code as input, and produce, as output, a report of
"possible" problems in the code.    These are problems that would typically NOT be caught by a
compiler, because they are not syntax errors, but instead represent things that are "suspicious", i.e.
they might be signs of either
* logic errors
* bad style
* code that is left over from previous development but is no longer useful

The "lint" utility was originally developed on Unix for C programming.   Lint-like-utilities now exist for many languages
including Java.  This repo contains this README with summaries about a variety of such utilities,
and subdirectories containing sample code.
